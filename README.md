# Fundamentals Of Engineering - Advanced Programming: Software Design Project

## About
This project utilizes the functionality of FEH Proteus Robot Controller, which was built using C++. In order to create some of the functionality of the game, parts of the library were rewritten, specifically the image processing. When sprites would go off of the screen, the parts that "fell off" of the screen would reappear at the bottom of the screen. This was rewritten such that the parts of the sprite that "fell off" no longer did so. In addition, the Proteus library had no animation functionality. This was created by utilizing the position of the mouse in order to update the sprites accordingly. This project was created by Trevor Gerald and Alex Zhang.
